                        Our place is a private, affordable stand-alone guest house centrally located just minutes to French Quartes, downtown, the Fair Groundzz (Jazz Fest) and City Park. The guest house is a quaint, 400 square ft. with a full bath, mini kitchen, & living room. The extra high ceilings make the home feel more spacious. The sofa converts to a bed also. We have a hand made counter area that adds character to the room and a great porch/deck to relax on and have a glass of Merlot.

                                Fantastic place. It was clean, Adrienne was great (even tough we did not neet in person) and everything went super smooth. Locations is also great if you like running and something a bit more quiet. I would suggest a car or take into consideration that you might have to Uber into the city from the location. Overall, would recommended the place anytime.
